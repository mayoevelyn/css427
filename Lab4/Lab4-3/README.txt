a. Change the UART connection between the Mega and Micro devices, using I2C instead.

b. All other functions should be the same as in exercise 2.

c. This basically means: 1) The Mega device will communicate with the Micro

   device via I2C back and forth; 2) The Micro device will communicate with the

   Mega device via I2C back and forth, plus, the Micro device will also need to

   collect sensor data from another I2C interface.
